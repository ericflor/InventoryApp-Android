# InventoryApp-Android
school assignment for small inventory tracking app in Anroid/Java

The requirements for this app were to build an andoird application that serves as a inventory tracking tool for a warehouse.
An employee must be able to register, login and then be brought to the main inventory tracking screen where a list of current inventory is displayed.
They should be abel to add/decrease inventory quanity as well as add new products into the inventory database.

This was a difficult project for me as I have all my experience in web development. Android specific architecture is pretty wonky so I struggled
quite a bit trying to figure out how different things need to be displayed and hooked together. I've got most of the logic down for the "backend"
portion but can't figure out why things aren't communicating with each other.
